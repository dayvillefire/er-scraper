# ER-SCRAPER

SaaS migration tool from Emergency Reporting, as their APIs are woefully inadequate for data retention on migration (IMHO).

DISCLAIMER: This tool is meant to allow data migration from an obsolete service for fire service personnel who already have legal access to that information. No part of this software was designed to circumvent controls, but rather to automate a potentially tedious process.
